# Shiny Potato is the DIY Power Supply for Hobbyists #

Most linear power supplies for electronics hobbyists are either quite expensive or lack many features that would satisfy the requirements of a DIY electronics lab.

## Lnear Regulator Based ##

Most cheap lab bench power supplies are switch mode power supplies. This introduces unwanted switching noise into your project and in some cases can even cause a test to fail or unpredicatable behavior. 
By using a Linear regulator it is both cost effective, stable and beginner freindly.

## Arduino Control ##

In order to achieve the most stability possible out of a budget DIY project an arduino UNO R3 will be used to give a Voltage readout, voltage regulator temperature monitoring and regulation by controlling a set of 12V fans.
